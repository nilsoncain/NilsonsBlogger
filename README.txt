---------------------Nilson's Blogger 0.10---------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
This program written in PHP allows you to make a weblog ('blog') without
the use of a database application.  Nilson's Blogger is in no way affiliated
with Blogger.com.  This program is open source, and free software.  The only
things that I ask of you if you do use my program is that you do not attempt
to sell it, repackage it, or in any way discredit Nilson Cain as the original
author of this program.  Of course, you are allowed to make mods, etc to this 
program (In fact, I encourage it).  You can even start a new blogging software
and base it on my code, but I wish to be contacted.  One more thing, 
please leave the comment in the index.php file to allow others to find and use this 
software.  Thanks, Nilson Cain.

To install and use Nilson's Blogger, you'll need the following:

o A PHP-compatible webserver
o PHP

If you are upgrading, backup your previous posts, then delete all remnances of the old install, then extract the new one.

Place all of these files in a directory of your choice.
Open config.php and set all of the variables.

To post, open post.php in your browser.
Posts and comments are stored in /posts/ by default

If you are upgrading from a previous version of Nilson's Blogger, you'll need to copy the old posts.txt over to the new install.

On UNIX-type systems, you'll probably need to CHMOD the directory that Nilson's Blogger will be stored in to 0777.

Always back up /posts/ when upgrading Blogger.  It could accidentally be over-written.  

That should do it.
